Hey there, I’m Shreya! 👋 Born and raised in the vibrant streets of Lucknow, where the culture is rich, and the food is unbeatable. 🍛 But guess what else thrived here? My love for tech!

It all started with me dabbling in coding during my BTech in Computer Science, but it wasn’t until my 3rd year that things clicked. You know that moment when you realize, “This is it!”? That was me with coding. I landed roles working on front-end and back-end projects, but life had a plot twist waiting. 🎯

Enter: Data Science. 💡 From the moment I dove into it, there was no looking back. Numbers, patterns, algorithms—it’s like I unlocked a whole new universe where data is king, and I’m the explorer mapping it out. 🚀 Whether it's machine learning, deep learning, or AI models, this is my playground now, and I’m investing all I’ve got to master it.

I’m all about constantly leveling up — from geeky side projects to intense full-time courses, it’s been a crazy journey that I’m loving every bit of. And trust me, this is just the beginning. The dream? To build game-changing AI models and dive deeper into the world of data-driven decisions. 🎓📊

When I’m not crunching numbers, you’ll probably find me exploring the latest tech trends, plotting my next big project, or hunting down the best momos spots in the city. 🥟
